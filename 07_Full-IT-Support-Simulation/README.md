# End-to-End Help Desk Onboarding Simulation

This lab project simulates the full onboarding workflow for a new employee in a Windows domain environment. The purpose was to demonstrate the technical and procedural steps involved in provisioning user accounts, applying appropriate permissions, configuring workstations, and documenting the process within a ticketing system—just as it would be handled in a real Help Desk or IT Support role.

The focus throughout this lab was not only on getting things to work, but also on ensuring that each step was implemented cleanly, logically, and with least-privilege security in mind.

## Overview

By the start of this lab, the following environment was already set up and running:

| Component | Hostname | Role | IP Address | Description |
|------------|-----------|------|-------------|--------------|
| **DC01** | `DC01` | Domain Controller | 192.168.10.10 | Active Directory Domain Services, DNS, DHCP |
| **Client01** | `Client01` | Workstation | DHCP | Domain-joined Windows 10 client |
| **Internal Network** | `LabNet` | Virtual Network | 192.168.10.0/24 | Isolated internal network used for domain communication |

This setup replicates a small corporate environment, with both machines connected through an isolated internal network to simulate a real enterprise domain.

## Scenario

A new employee joined the company and required full IT onboarding.  
I completed the setup as follows:

1. Created a new user account in **Active Directory**
2. Configured the account and assigned group memberships
3. Created a new **Security Group (IT_Staff)** and added the user
4. Applied folder and printer access automatically using **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** tied to that security group
5. Logged in as the new user to verify access to shared resources and printing
6. Documented the full workflow inside the ticketing system

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Created the User Account in Active Directory

I created the new user account in **Active Directory Users and Computers**, assigned an initial password, and prepared the account for first login.

### 2. Created and Assigned Security Group Membership

I created the **IT_Staff** security group to represent users who require access to departmental shared drive space and printers.  
The new user was added to this group.

### 3. Configured Shared Folder Permissions

I configured permissions at both the **share** and **NTFS** levels to ensure proper access control.  
Members of *IT_Staff* were granted appropriate read/write permissions.

### 4. Logged In as the New User and Verified Access

I logged into the workstation as the new user to confirm profile creation, authentication, and baseline access.

### 5. Automated Drive Mapping via Group Policy

To avoid manual mapping and to ensure consistent access across machines, I created a **GPO** that automatically maps the departmental shared drive whenever a user in the **IT_Staff** group logs in.

### 6. Configured Office Printer Access via GPO

I added the office printer and deployed it via GPO so that users in the **IT_Staff** group automatically receive the printer connection when they log in.

## What This Demonstrates

This lab demonstrates the ability to:

- Manage users and security groups in **Active Directory**
- Apply **least privilege access control** using share and NTFS permissions
- Use **Group Policy Objects** to automate workstation configuration and user experience
- Verify successful configuration from the end-user perspective
- Maintain consistent internal documentation and ticket history

These are core responsibilities of real-world IT Support and Help Desk roles.

---

## Summary

This onboarding simulation reflects a complete support workflow from account provisioning to workstation readiness. The project emphasizes both technical accuracy and structured documentation—skills that are essential in professional support environments.

The result:  
A new user can sign in, access the correct shared files, and print to the appropriate office printer—without manual setup on each workstation.
