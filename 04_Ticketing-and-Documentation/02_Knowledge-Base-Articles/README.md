# Knowledge Base (KB) Articles

**Objective:**  
The goal of this lab was to create clear, concise, and practical Knowledge Base (KB) articles to support end-users and streamline IT support processes. This simulates the kind of documentation that a professional Help Desk team would maintain for common issues and routine tasks.

**Scope:**  
I wrote 3–5 KB articles covering frequent IT support requests. Each article includes step-by-step instructions and troubleshooting guidance, designed for users with varying technical expertise.
