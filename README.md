# Help Desk Labs  
**Practical IT Support & Troubleshooting Portfolio**

---

## About This Repository  
This repository contains a series of **hands-on labs** that demonstrate real-world IT Support and Help Desk skills.  

Each project recreates scenarios that an IT professional might face in a production environment — including user account management, Active Directory administration, network troubleshooting, and ticket-based problem resolution.  

The purpose of these labs is to show a practical, organized approach to diagnosing and solving technical issues, while maintaining a strong focus on communication, documentation, and user experience.
