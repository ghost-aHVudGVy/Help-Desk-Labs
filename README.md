## About This Repository  

This repository is a collection of hands-on labs I’ve built to strengthen and demonstrate my Help Desk and IT Support skills.  

Each lab walks through real scenarios I’d face in a support role - setting up and managing Active Directory, troubleshooting network issues, configuring printers, handling tickets, and more.  

My goal with this labs is to simulate what it’s like to work in a real IT environment while documenting every step of the process clearly and professionally. It’s a way for me to keep learning and show my practical experience in IT support.
